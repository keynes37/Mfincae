  abstract = {This paper discusses estimation and limited-information goodness-of-fit test statistics in factor models for binary data using pairwise likelihood estimation and sampling weights. The paper extends the applicability of pairwise likelihood estimation for factor models with binary data to accommodate complex sampling designs. Additionally, it introduces two key limited-information test statistics: the Pearson chi-squared test and the Wald test. To enhance computational efficiency, the paper introduces modifications to both test statistics. The performance of the estimation and the proposed test statistics under simple random sampling and unequal probability sampling is evaluated using simulated data.},

  abstract = {This article introduces the first publicly available dataset for analyzing the Brunei housing market, covering 31,495 property listings from 1993 to 2024. The dataset, curated from property advertisements in newspapers and online platforms, includes key attributes such as price, location, property type, and physical characteristics, enriched with area-level spatial information. Comprehensive and historical, it complements the Brunei Darussalam Central Bank's Residential Property Price Index (RPPI), addressing the limitations of restricted access to raw RPPI data and its relatively short timeline since 2015. Data collection involved manual transcription from archival sources and automated web scraping using programmatic methods, supported by innovative cleaning with large language models (LLMs) to structure unformatted text. The dataset enables spatial and temporal analysis, with potential applications in economics, urban planning, and real estate research. While minor limitations exist, such as potential missing values and spatial coverage bias toward the Brunei-Muara district, this dataset provides a robust foundation for exploring housing market trends and informing policy decisions.},

  abstract = {Amidst the global demand for learning English, a proliferation of scholarship continues to highlight learner difficulties and anxiety to master English as a second/foreign language, particularly in classroom settings. This study is significant as it is the first empirical study on foreign language anxiety (FLA) in a Malay-Islamic higher education teacher training setting that is concerned with formal Islamic edification in Brunei Darussalam. By utilising the FLA theoretical framework by Horwitz et al. (1986) and Foreign Language Classroom Anxiety Scale (FLCAS), this study found that the general observation on FLCAS among Islamic trainee teachers attending English for Islamic Education as part of English for Specific Purposes module does not show a clear indication of FLA. However, further analysis shows that Test Anxiety and General Anxiety in classrooms have contributed to high levels of FLA among these learners. Our study also proposes some pedagogical and research implications that can be applied in other contexts sharing similar tradition and cultural settings in language education, and as part of comparative and transnational studies across the globe.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the first spatio-temporal analysis of property prices in Brunei Darussalam, a small, resource-rich economy with distinct housing market characteristics. Despite global interest in quantitative housing market analyses, Brunei's market remains underexplored, with prior studies predominantly qualitative. Addressing this gap, \$N=3,763\$ residential transactions from 2015 to 2023 were analysed using Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) priors to model spatial dependencies and temporal trends in house prices accounting for other price determinants. Emerging Hotspot Analysis was then employed to classify price clustering across time. Key findings revealed significant spatial autocorrelation (\${\textbackslash}rho = 0.43\$) and temporal persistence best modeled by an autoregressive structure of order 2, indicating that market reactions to changes can extend up to six months. The results demonstrate the critical role of spatial and temporal factors in shaping property prices, providing actionable insights for policy interventions and real estate market analysis, particularly in addressing disparities between urban and rural housing markets.},

  abstract = {The aim of this research was the analysis of the effect of a dam height raise on the water quality of a tropical reservoir used for drinking water purposes in South East Asia. Analyses of iron, manganese, pH and ammonia were performed over a 5-year period from daily water sampling at the reservoir. In addition, high-frequency monitoring data of nitrate, ammonium, pH and blue-green algae were obtained using a monitoring probe. The results showed that due to the raising of the reservoir water level, previously oxic sediments became submerged, triggering an increase in iron and manganese in particular due to the establishment of reducing conditions. Manganese concentrations with values up to 4~mg L-1 are now exceeding guideline values. The analysis strongly indicated that both iron and manganese have a seasonal component with higher iron and manganese concentrations during the wet season. Over a three-year period afterwards, concentrations did not go back to pre-raise levels. The change in water quality was accompanied by a change in pH from previous values of around 5 to pH values of around 6.5. Geochemical simulations confirmed the theory that the increasing concentrations of iron and manganese are due to the dissolution of MnO2 and ferric oxyhydroxides oxidising organic matter in the process. This study showed that changes in reservoir water levels with the establishment of reducing conditions can have long-term effects on the water quality of a reservoir.},

  abstract = {This study illustrated the changes, pollution status, and significant pollution causes for Brunei River, Brunei Darussalam. Eleven parameters (pH, temperature, oxidation--reduction potential (ORP), dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, conductivity, total dissolved solids (TDS), salinity, turbidity, ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N), and total coliform) were analyzed from eight monitoring sites in 1984, 2019, 2020, and 2021. Box plots were used for a comparative study between 1984 and 2019+ data, while hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) tests were performed on data from recent years (2019+). The box plot analysis showed that pollution levels in 2019, 2020, and 2021 increased compared to 1984 values, especially for total coliform bacteria. The doubling of the coliform bacteria concentration in the river between 1984 and 2019+ is concerning because the Malaysia National Water Quality Standards (NWQS) guideline values for fishing have now been exceeded. HCA pointed out that upstream stations are more polluted than downstream. PCA of the 11 water quality datasets generated five factors with a total variance of 75.21\% and identified anthropogenic activities, seawater intrusion, and hydrological processes as possible causes for Brunei River water quality degradation.},

  abstract = {Institutional mathematicsMathematics~education has long been traditional in its ways of being teacher-centric, a tradition which perhaps dates back to the Ancient Greece. Much like the society in those days, where there was a wary public feeling about the rigidness of the mathematical instruction in Pythagoras' school, mathematics educators find themselves in a similar position in the common era of 2020. Unlike the Ancient Greece however, the battle is for the sustained delivery of a comprehensive mathematics education in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic. It would be fair to say that mathematics departments across all levels of the education sector have been affected drastically; more so on instructors who favour the traditional ``chalk and talk'' method of instruction. In this article, we share several lessons learned in the delivery of mathematical instruction at undergraduate university level during the Covid-19 pandemic, drawing on our experience at Universiti Brunei Darussalam. These include specific methods for implementing online learning effectively, the pros and cons of such methods, and how we can use computer based tools to make learning more conducive. We highly think that these implementations are beneficial to be adapted by mathematics departments anywhere as a means of adapting to the new realities post Covid-19.},

This retrospective study used de-identified data obtained from the Al-Islah Rehabilitation Center for the period 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2017. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses with a stepwise variable selection method were used to estimate and determine significant factors associated with readmission to the center. A total of 92 out of 705 subjects (13\%) were readmitted to the rehabilitation center within the study period, with ages ranging from 20 to 59 years (M = 36.1, SD = 8.6 years). Multiple logistic regression found that subjects who were in the age group of 40 to 49 (OR = 2.24, 95\% CI [1.16, 4.37]) resided in the Belait district (OR = 1.94, 95\% CI [1.00, 3.63]), divorced or widowed (OR = 2.14, 95\% CI [1.19, 3.82]), had committed other criminal offenses (OR = 1.91, 95\% CI [1.16, 3.11]), and voluntarily admitted (OR = 2.33, 95\% CI [1.34, 4.01]), were found to be significantly more likely to get readmitted to the rehabilitation center. This study provides evidence of sociodemographic factors in relation to readmission to the rehabilitation center in Brunei Darussalam.},

  abstract = {Methods for the treatment of item non-response in attitudinal scales and in large-scale assessments under the pairwise likelihood (PL) estimation framework and under a missing at random (MAR) mechanism are proposed. Under a full information likelihood estimation framework and MAR, ignorability of the missing data mechanism does not lead to biased estimates. However, this is not the case for pseudo-likelihood approaches such as the PL. We develop and study the performance of three strategies for incorporating missing values into confirmatory factor analysis under the PL framework, the complete-pairs (CP), the available-cases (AC) and the doubly robust (DR) approaches. The CP and AC require only a model for the observed data and standard errors are easy to compute. Doubly-robust versions of the PL estimation require a predictive model for the missing responses given the observed ones and are computationally more demanding than the AC and CP. A simulation study is used to compare the proposed methods. The proposed methods are employed to analyze the UK data on numeracy and literacy collected as part of the OECD Survey of Adult Skills.},
